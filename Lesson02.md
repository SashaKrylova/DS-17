But I will try to fix it even if in need to learn something as hard as this formula: $y_{sub}=\sqrt{(}x_{sub})$

Or learn how to use Python code like this:

```
import matplotlib

game_is_on = True
while game_is_on:
    screen.update()
    time.sleep(0.1)
    snake.move()

```

_Here is the sample mean:_   
$\overline{y}=\frac{1}{n} \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i$

_Here is the sample variance:_   
$\sigma^2=\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i-\overline{y})^2}{n-1}$

_Here is the sample standard deviation:_   
$\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i-\overline{y})^2}{n-1}}$
